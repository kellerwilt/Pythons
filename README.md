# Python Tutorial
These are some file IO and OO examples. <!-- (Clarify thisâ€”what does IO and OO mean?) -->


[Patients.py](https://github.com/kellerwilt/Python-Tutorials/blob/master/Patients.py) contains an importer class that interacts with [Patients.txt](https://github.com/kellerwilt/Python-Tutorials/blob/master/Patients.txt) to retrieve the data for each patient. Let's start with the file that we're reading the data from. `Patients.txt` has one line for every patient. Each line contains several pieces of data for that patient, separated by commas, in the following format:


Patient Name | Height | Weight | age | Date of Last Appointment
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
_(first name)_ | _(inches)_ | _(pounds)_ | _(years)_ | _(yyyy,mm,dd)_
George,  | 72, | 187, | 38, | 2015, 05, 28
Jackson, | 73, | 210, | 35, | 2015, 03, 18
Jim, | 72, | 190, | 34, | 2015, 01, 30
Chuck, | 69, | 180, | 29, | 2015, 02, 24
Corey, | 68, | 230, | 31, | 2014, 04, 03

Let's start with displaying the date before we analyze and display all of our data.
We will need the `datetime` module to find today's date, and do any calculations involving time.
`datetime.today()` is a function of the `datetime` module that returns the current date:

```Python
>>> from datetime import datetime

>>> today = datetime.today()

>>> today

datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 26, 8, 58, 29, 899000)
```
You can see that it doesn't return `2015, 5, 26, 8, 55, 59, 205000`, or `May 26th, 2015`, and if you check the type, it's actually in datetime's own format.

```Python
>>> type(today)

<type 'datetime.datetime'>
```

I wanted the program to display the date in a sentence, so to make it look nice I can use the attributes of the variable that we assigned to the current date.
```Python
>>> today.weekday()
1
>>> today.day
26
>>> today.year
2015
>>> today.weekday()
1
>>> today.month
5
```

This sentence is confusing, startingat "and get an element..." : As you can see, `today.weekday()` doesn't return `'Tuesday'` and `today.month` doesn't return `'May'` months/weekdays, and get an element from that list using the data from `today.month` or `today.weekday` (we subtract one because start counting at 0).
```Python
>>> weekdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
>>> weekdays[today.weekday() - 1]
"Tuesday"

>>> months = ["January", "Fabruary", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
>>> months[today.month - 1]
"May"
```
We can put together a string that displays the date the way a human would by doing something like this:
```Python
print "Today is " + weekdays[today.weekday() - 1] + ", " + months[today.month - 1] +
' ' + str(today.day) + ', ' + str(today.year)
```

This returns `Today is Tuesday, June 26, 2015 `

Next, the program, `Patients.py` contains 2 classes: `PatientsImporter` and `Patient`.

The `PatientsImporter` class reads through each line and puts the data in a more readable format. It then figures out when the next appointment should be, based on when the previous one was (appointments occur every 5 months), and determines how many days remain until the next appointment. If an appointment was scheduled for the current day, it updates patients.txt with the data from that day's appointment, and resets the last appointment's date. Then the importer gives all this data to the `Patient` class.

The `Patient` class displays everything to the user. If the next appointment is in less than a month, it displays the number of days until the next appointment. The `Patient` class also sends out texts to remind patients of upcoming appointments (the code for texts are currently commented so we don't text someone every time we test the program). It sends texts 10 days before, one day before, and the day of the appointment.

Let's go over how all this works.

Before anything else, we need to open `Patients.txt`. The syntax for this is `open(file, mode, buffering)`. The `file` argument is a string containing the file's address. The next argument, `mode`, determines what you are able to do with the file (read, write, etc.). By default it opens in read, which is all we need for now. We can just make a variable, file, and set `file = open("Patients.txt")`.

To start reading the file, we will want to get each line into a string. We can do this using the `readline()` attribute on `file`. `.readline()` returns a line of the file in the form of a string. Every time you call this function, it moves to the next line, meaning that calling `file.readline()` once would return the first line of `file`, but calling it a second time would return the second line. So, we can just make a `while` loop and set `line = file.readline()` at the beginning of the the loop to iterate through it line by line.

Now that we have the data for the first patient, we can start picking it apart and taking what we need. Most of this can be done for us using the `split()` function. Calling `split()` on a string will turn it into a list containing all the different pieces separated by a given string (a space by default), so `"thing1 thing2 thing3".split()` would return `["thing1", "thing2", "thing3"]`. All we have to do is call `line.split(',')`, and then set different variables to their corresponding elements in the list we get.

We can make our own datetime object in the format mentioned before by setting a variable to `datetime.date(year, month, day)`. So to make the variable `last_appointment`, we declare it equal to `calling datetime.date()` on the appropriate elements of the list we made earlier with `line.split()`. Now we need to find when the next appointment should be, and how many days are left until then.

To find the date of the next appointment, we need to add 5 months to the date of the last appointment. Using the `.replace()` function from d`atetime`, we can replace different values without going through the whole process of making a `datetime` object again. We can use modulo to keep the month between 1 and 12. Python rounds down when working with integers, which can help us by changing the year when necessary. When we add `(last_appointment.month + 5) / 12` to the year, if the month plus 5 is less than 12, then dividing it by 12 will be less than one, and will be rounded down to 0, but if the result is more than 12, we end up changing the year by one.

```Python
next_appointment = last_appointment.replace(month = last_appointment.month + 5 % 12,
year = last_appointment.year + (last_appointment.month + 5) / 12)
```

Now we just have to find how many days are left until the next appointment. This would be very difficult using the default Python library. We would have to set up something that tracks the number of days in each month and track which months would go by from appointment to appointment. `datetime` however, can add and subtract dates quite easily, so by simply finding the current date and subtracting it from the next appointment, the attribute `.days` will give us what we need;

```Python
until_next_appointment = (next_appointment - today).days
```

To organize all this information, we can make a list, and every time the program finishes gathering all the data for a patient, it adds it to the list as a `Patient` object. Here our Patient class takes all the data and puts it in a more presentable form. We need the `Patients` class to all the data as arguments: <!-- (Is this setence missing a word?) -->
```Python
class Patient:
    def __init__(self, name, height, weight, age, last_appointment, next_appointment,
    until_next_appointment):
        self.name
        self.height
        self.weight
        self.age
        self.last_appointment
        self.next_appointment
        self.until_next_appointment
```
Then, back in the `PatientsImporter` class, we add an instance of `Patient` to our `patients` list:
```Python
patients.append(Patient(self.name, self.height, self.weight, self.age,
self.last_appointment, self.next_appointment, self.until_next_appointment))
```
If you tried printing an instance of Patient, you would realize it doesn't exactly give you anything helpful. By default it should return something along the lines of `<__main__.Patient instance at 0x7fe5405dc050>`. To fix this, we can tell the computer what we want it to do when we call `print` on an instance of our class by defining '__str__()'
```
def __str__(self):
        info = "Name: " + str(self.name).title() + '\n'
        info += "Height: " + str(self.height) + '\n'
        info += "Weight: " + str(self.weight) + '\n'
        info += "Age: " + str(self.age) + '\n'
        info += "Last appointment: " + str(self.last_appointment.year) + '-' + str(self.last_appointment.month) + '-' + str(self.last_appointment.day) + '\n'
        if self.until_next_appointment.days < 31:
            info += "Upcoming appointment: " + str(self.next_appointment) + " in " + str(self.until_next_appointment.days) + " days."
        else:
            info += "Upcoming appointment: " + str(self.next_appointment)
        return info
```
`'\n'` is added to `info` every time we plug in a new variable because `'\n'`, when put in a string, signifies the end of a line. Using `'\n'` makes info a multi-line string that we can return at the end.
Now, printing out an instance of `Patient` will return something like this:
```
Name: Corey
Height: 68
Weight: 230
Age: 31
Last appointment: 2015-4-3
Upcoming appointment: 2015-09-03
```
Finally, we go through the list and print the data, and give any necessary reminders using a `for` loop:


```Python
patients = PatientImporter("Patients.txt")
for i in patients:
    print i
    i.remind_patients()
```
